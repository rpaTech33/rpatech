                    <p>Robotic Process Automation consultants use proven technological developments to manipulate
                        application software to perform processes in a similar way a human would do. They explore
                        possibilities in teaching robots how to accomplish human tasks in a faster and more accurate
                        way. With the wealth of experience from working on complex projects, the RPA consultant carries
                        the organization through planning, definition, design configuration, testing, and operations
                        changeover.</p>

                    <p>The need to drive faster and more accurate processes is gaining momentum. To meet the growing
                        market demands, businesses are affecting process changes by augmenting human activity with
                        automation. With efficiency being at the core of improving business processes, companies can
                        meet their objectives by implementing methods that relate business needs with automation
                        solutions. RPA consultants create robots that accelerate day-to-day employee tasks thus
                        achieving efficiency.</p>

                <h2 class="common-h2">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <div id="faq-accordion">


                    <h3>Why should I start using RPA software ?</h3>
                    <p>To answer this question, we should briefly explain what RPA is. RPA refers to software robots
                        that take over simple, repetitive tasks from humans. For example, human actions like entering,
                        retyping, or copying information. RPA software can perform these tasks quicker, more accurately,
                        and at a higher level of quality than humans would. The advantages are higher customer and
                        employee satisfaction, a decrease in processing time, and lower working capacity.</p>

                    <h3>How do I get started with RPA ?</h3>
                    <p>Business and IT leaders can use these steps as a guide to develop an RPA implementation strategy
                        that ensures its success and future scalability.
                        <br>1. Book a meeting with our automation experts to assess your Intelligent Automation
                        opportunities
                        <br>2. Build your RPA business case
                        <br>3. Determine the optimal operating model
                        <br>4. Plan your automation roadmap
                    </p>

                    <h3>What are the challenges of RPA ?</h3>
                    <p>There are multiple challenges that can appear when implementing RPA in your organization, here
                        are three of the major and most common ones:
                        <br>-Employee resistance and onboarding: Any technology implementation comes with changes that
                        can result in stress for employees. In the case of RPA there is also the belief that bringing in
                        automation, equals to layoffs, creating some adoption resistance.
                        <br><br>-Selecting the right processes: It is vital to determine which processes are suitable
                        for RPA so that automation runs successfully. This requires an in-depth analysis and should not
                        be rushed to deploy, as this might lead to failure to meet the expectations.
                        <br><br>-Setting realistic RPA expectations: Companies need to recognize the limits of what RPA
                        can do and understand that RPA will not fix broken processes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is the added value of RPA ?</h3>
                    <p>The added work capacity that RPA offers can be used for a variety of tasks. This allows employees
                        to spend their time on tasks that interest them and that only they can perform. This way, you
                        are optimizing your resources, ensuring all tasks are performed at a higher quality and in a
                        more cost-effective manner.</p>

                    <h3>What is the relationship between RPA & AI ?</h3>
                    <p>RPA and AI are often named in the same conversation. Combining RPA and AI offers you the ideal
                        combination. The collaboration between AI and RPA extends and improves the possibilities.
                        Learning from every task. Alone, RPA does not have the cognitive capacity to take on any of the
                        interpretations. The combination extends and improves the reach of RPA by allowing it to map
                        business processes and automize processes at a more detailed level.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What about my employees ?</h3>
                    <p>It is natural for your employees' first response to be shocked when they are told a robot will be
                        taking over part of their work. However, in reality, the robot only takes over the work
                        employees usually enjoy least. They are the repetitive and simple tasks that are least likely to
                        energize employees. Eliminating these tasks provides employees with more time for fun and
                        challenging work. By allowing employees to experience RPA, they are given the chance to see the
                        opportunity it could offer them rather than the threat.</p>
